\section flclusterDesc FLCLUSTER Description

<b>FLCLUSTER</b> is a program for accessing dxcluster nodes.

\image latex flcluster.png "" width=5.0in
\image html flcluster.png ""

<br>
flcluster can connect to and display data from DX cluster servers.  The three
most common server types are AR-Cluster, CC-Cluster, and DX Spider.  The
program is designed to work stand alone or as a helper application to fldigi.
It can move call, mode, and frequency data from a spotted QSO to the appropriate
fldigi controls.  It can query fldigi for the same items when generating a spot
report.

\section s_logon Logging on to remote host
Before any logon you should configure flcluster with your basic personal information.  Check
the "Enable Tooltlips" if you want a small tooltip popup window to display when the cursor hovers
over an flcluster control.
<br>

flcluster needs to send occassionally send a backspace character (keepalive) to the cluster server.  The
server echos backspace.  If the echo is not received within a 30 second window then the server
connection is assumed to be down.  flcluster will attempt to reconnect if this occurs.  Receipt of
a broadcast message such as a dx spot report will also serve to satisfy the echo receipt.  You
can set the keepalive interval to 1, 5, or 10 minutes.  5 should probably suffice for most servers and
internet paths.

Enter the DX HOST hostname/IP, the Port and your Login call.  Then check
the "Connect" control.  The "Connected" label will be visible only after
the remote host connection has been been made.
<br>

Immediately after checking the "Connect" control the dxcluster dialog should
change to the "TelNet stream" tab.  This tab displays the raw telnet data
stream, shown here for the Ed's server, w3nr.ddns.net.  Ed runs his DX Spider
node on a Pi3 / Raspbian operating system.

\subsection s_dxc_config_hosts Managing Hosts
You can maintain a list of remote hosts to which you can reliably connect and
which provide good information relative to your QRA (Maidenhead locator).  The
following refers to the Cluster Config tab.

<center>
\image html cluster-config.png ""
\image latex cluster-config.png "" width=5.0in
</center>

<ul>
<li>Add the current host to the list using the "Add" button.</li>
<li>Highlight an entry and press the "Select" button to transfer the elements
to the connect controls.</li>
<li>Highlight an entry and press the "Delete" button to delete an entry.</li>
</ul>
Press the "Servers" button if you are unfamiliar with the telnet address and 
port number of a convenient dxcluster server.  fldigi will open up a local
html document with a list of recently verified servers:
<center>
\image html dxc_servers.png ""
\image latex dxc_servers.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
<br>

With the exception of the cluster server setup commands (next section), flcluster
will automatically save changes that you make in it's configuration.  flcluster
saves all setup and other related files to it's working folder:
<br>

<center>
| Operating System  | Folder/Directory                                          |
| :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows           | C:\\Documents and Settings\\\<username\>\\flcluster.files |
| Vista             | C:\\Users\\\<username\>\\flcluster.files                  |
| Linux             | /home/\<username\>/.flcluster                             |
| Apple OS X        | /Users/User_Login_Name/.flcluster                         |
</center>
<br>

\subsection s_dxc_config_init_cmds Initial Host Commands
Most cluster servers will save your setup commands from a previous telnet
session.  You can also store those commands in the text editing control,
"Cluster Server Setup Cmds."
<br>

You can save and reload any number of command sequences.  Each is saved in a plain text
file in the flcluster files subfolder "Scripts".  The default extension for the dxcluster
scripts is "dxc".  Be sure you add the extension to your saved files.
It will not be added if you do not with the result that file may not be
visible when you try to load it.
<br>

Send the script to the remote server using the "Send" button.  The transmission and
response will be available for viewing on the "TelNet stream" tab.
\subsection s_dxc_config_macros Command Macros
Configure each of the 8 command macro buttons.  The m1...m8 controls are
the button label and the corresponding multi-line text control are the
associated server commands.
<br>
DX cluster command help can be viewed for each of the 3 server types.  
Press the corresponding help button:

\image html dx_spider_help.png ""
\image latex dx_spider_help.png "" width=5.0in
</center>

\subsection s_auto_spotting  Spot when logged
Enable the "Spot when logged" in fldigi if you want to create the spot report
whenever you log a contact from the fldigi main dialog.  You will still have
to review the spot report and submit it with the Submit button.  You must be
connected to fldigi for this to work.

\subsection s_auto_connect  Auto Connect to Host
Enable the "Auto Connect" if you want to connect to the host when starting
fldigi.

\subsection s_cluster_colors DX cluster color scheme
You can change the text colors, and text fonts on the User config tab.

<center>
\image html colors-fonts-config.png ""
\image latex colors-fonts-config.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
\section s_dxc_stream TelNet stream
The raw data to and from the cluster server is shown on the TelNet stream tab.
Sent data is in red and received data is in black.
<center>
\image html raw-data.png ""
\image latex raw-data.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
<br>

The TelNet stream text display is context sensitive to the right mouse button.
You can copy marked text or delete the display contents using the right mouse
button.
<br>

You can send individual commands to the remote host using the "Cmd:" control.
Enter the command, for example: "SHow/FILTER", or "SH/FILTER".  Then press the
"Submit" button.  The command string will be sent to the remote server and you
can view the results on the "TelNet stream" tab.
<br>

During a logon to the remote host flcluster will send some default commands depending
on the host type.  If the remote host is either an CC-Cluster or DX Spider host then
flcluster will send this sequence:
\verbatim
     set/page 0
     set/name [user name]
     set/qth [user qth]
     set/qra [user locator]
\endverbatim
Where the [] values are those entered on the main "User" configuration tab.
<br>

Sending prepared (macro) commands or dx spot reports to the remote server is
a two step process. Pressing any of the 4 macro buttons will transfer the macro string to the
Cmd: control.  You can modify the command string before pressing the Submit
button.
\subsection s_dxc_spotting Submitting a spot
You generate a spot report using the Spot button on the TelNet stream tab.
Flcluster will generate a spot report that tries to provide the cluster with
some mode details.  For example:
\verbatim
dx 3512.4 K2LBM RTTY [85]       mode is RTTY, Mark frequency @ 3512.485
dx 3581.1 K2LBM MFSK16 [50]     mode is MFSK16, center frequency @ 3581.150
dx 3580.8 K2LBM OLIVIA [00]     mode is OLIVIA (8-500), center frequency @ 3580.800
\endverbatim
Unfortunately, the ADIF mode specifier does not provide details reqarding mode
characteristics.  The [0..99] values in the notes field denote the additional
Hertz and tens-of-Hertz needed to specifiy the frequency to the nearest Hertz
rather than rounded as is usually reported in the cluster spot report.  This
field is only added to the report if the "Report [0..99 Hz]" control is
enabled on the dxcluster configure tab.
<br>
You enable the [hz] report in the comments section by checking this configuration
control:
<center>
\image html report-hz.png ""
\image latex report-hz.png "" width=2.0in
</center>

<br>

Pressing either of the SPOT buttons only adds the spot report to the Cmd: control.  You
can then modify the spot report before actually submitting the report using
the Submit button.

\section s_dxcluster_reports DX cluster reports
flcluster parses the received data stream and displays each dx spot in a tabular form on
the "DX Reports" tab:
<center>
\image html dx-reports.png ""
\image latex dx-reports.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
If connected to fldigi, left clicking on a spotted report line will transfer the frequency and mode to fldigi's
operating parameters.  The mode change is contingent on the mode being reported by the
spotter and included in the 'Notes' block.
<br>

You can elect to view the reports with the most recent on either the top or
the bottom of the list.

\subsection fldigi_io_interface Connecting to fldigi
<center>
\image html i-o-config.png ""
\image latex i-o-config.png "" width=5.0in
</center>
<br>
Use the default address and port entries for fldigi, unless you have specifically
changed those for the currently running fldigi.  flcluster and fldigi do not have
to be executing on the same computer.  Enter the address as a LAN or WAN URL or
socket address as appropriate.
<ul>
<li>Socket address: 127.0.0.1</li>
<li>Socket port   : 7362</li>
</ul>
Set the PSK, CW and RTTY sweet spots to be identical to those in fldigi.
<br>
The xcvr set up and RTTY Mark Freq check boxes should be self explanatory.  The state
of these controls will determine how flcluster calculates the transceiver suppressed carrier /
audio (waterfall) track points.  The computed values will be sent to fldigi when a spotted
QSO is activated on the DX Reports tab.
<br>
If fldigi is currently executing, then flcluster will connect as soon as the "connect to Fldigi" box
is checked.  flcluster will automatically connect to fldigi if you exit flcluster with that box checked.

\subsection s_dxc_qsy_logic DX Cluster QSY logic
A cluster spot report line has this format:
\verbatim
-SPOTTER---<-FREQ--><--DX STA---><----------NOTES--------------><-UTC><LOC--
KB8O       14240.0  D66D         up 10 59 Ohio                  2059Z EN81
\endverbatim
fldigi will change mode if and only if the NOTES block contains a valid ADIF
mode specifier, i.e. CW, PSK31, QPSK63, RTTY, etc.<br>

The QSY logic does not make any assumptions regarding band, sub band in
determining the RF carrier and AF injection frequency.<br>

If the fldigi mode is SSB (available on the mode menu), then the QSY is
to the FREQ value with no change in the WF tracking frequency.<br>

Otherwise the existing mode or the mode detected in the NOTES is used
to determine the QSY values:
\verbatim
CW:   QSY is based on the CW sweet spot
RTTY: QSY is based on the RTTY sweet spot
PSK:  QSY is based on the PSK sweet spot
DIGI: QSY is based on the PSK sweet spot
\endverbatim
Most DX reports do not include a mode usage.  Ergo it is up to the user to
know what mode he or she is interested in.  Are you spotting SSB, then change
the fldigi mode to SSB.  Are you interested in CW?  Then change the mode to
CW.  This is really a KISS approach that is constrained by the very limited
amount of data contained in the DX spot report.
\section s_cluster_help On Line Cluster Help
The Help tab provides a convenient access to help obtained directly from the dxcluster
server.  It is the equivalent of using the HELP command from the Cmd: control.  The
difference is that the server reply is parsed and presented in a separate text viewer.
